<p>
    glbinding is a generated, cross-platform C++ binding for OpenGL which is solely based on the new xml-based OpenGL API specification (gl.xml).
    It is a fully fledged OpenGL API binding compatible with current code based on other C bindings, e.g., GLEW.
    The binding is generated using python scripts and templates, that can be easily adapted to fit custom needs.
    glbinding can be used as an alternative to GLEW and other projects, e.g., glad, gl3w, glLoadGen, glload, and flextGL.

<p>
    glbinding leverages modern C++11 features like enum classes, lambdas, and variadic templates, instead of relying on macros (all OpenGL symbols are real functions and variables).
    It provides type-safe parameters, per feature API header, lazy function resolution, multi-context and multi-thread support, global function callbacks, meta information about the generated OpenGL binding and the OpenGL runtime, as well as multiple examples for quick-starting your projects.

<p>
    Current gl code, written with a typical C binding for OpenGL is fully compatible for the use with glbinding. Just replace all includes to the old binding and use the appropriate api namespace.
