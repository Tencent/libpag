## Introduction
***

The PAGExporter is a plugin for Adobe After Effects (AE), enabling designers to export motion effects created in AE into asset files with one click.  
While supporting more AE features in pure vector export mode, it also introduces hybrid export mode combining BMP pre-compositions with vectors, supporting all AE features while maintaining runtime editable.

## Development
***

We recommend using the CLion IDE on macOS for development.

### Environment Setup

First, download the AESDK from the following link:

`https://developer.adobe.com/console/3505738/servicesandapis`

We recommend downloading the 2023 Windows version. After extraction, write the absolute path of the AESDK to `./AESDK.cfg`. Example content of the file:

`set(AE_SDK_PATH /Users/[username]/libpag/exporter/vendor/AfterEffectsSDK/Examples)`

Next, write the QT cmake path to `QTCMAKE.cfg`. Example content of the file:

`set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH /Users/[username]/Qt/6.6.1/macos/lib/cmake)`

Other environment dependencies are the same as [libpag](../README.md).

### Building the Project

Ensure that libpag can be compiled successfully before attempting to compile the PAGExporter. Open the project root directory directly in CLion to start the compilation.

**For macOS:**

No additional CLion configuration is needed.

**For Windows:**

Follow these steps to configure CLion correctly:

- Ensure you have installed the **[Desktop development with C++]** and **[Universal Windows Platform development]** components for VS2019.
- Open the **File->Settings** panel, go to **Build, Execution, Deployment->Toolchains**, and set the toolchain to **Visual Studio** with **amd64 (Recommended)** or **x86** architecture.

**Note: If you encounter issues during the CMake build, update to the latest version of the CMake
command-line tool and try again.**
