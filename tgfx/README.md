# TGFX

TGFX (Tencent Graphics) is a lightweight 2D graphics library designed for rendering texts,
geometries, and images. It provides high-performance APIs that work across a variety of GPU hardware
and software platforms, including iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, Web, and more. TGFX was
originally designed to serve as the default graphics engine for the [PAG](https://pag.io) project
starting from version 4.0. Its main objective is to offer a compelling alternative to the Skia graphics
library while maintaining a much smaller binary size. Over time, it has found its way into many other
products, such as [Hippy](https://github.com/Tencent/Hippy), [Tencent Docs](https://docs.qq.com) and
various video-editing apps.

TGFX has been relocated to an independent repository. For more information, please visit: https://github.com/Tencent/tgfx
