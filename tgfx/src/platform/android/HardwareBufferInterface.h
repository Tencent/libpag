   * If rect is not NULL, the caller promises to modify only data in the area specified by rect.

   * THREADING CONSIDERATIONS:
   *
   * It is legal for several different threads to lock a buffer for read access; none of the threads
   * are blocked.
   *
   * Locking a buffer simultaneously for write or read/write is undefined, but will neither
   * terminate the process nor block the caller; AHardwareBuffer_lock may return an error or leave
   * the buffer's content into an indeterminate state.
   *
   * @returns 0 on success, -EINVAL if buffer is NULL or if the usage flags are not a combination of
   * AHARDWAREBUFFER_USAGE_CPU_*, or an error number of the lock fails for any reason.
