/**
 * The ImageReader class allows direct access to ImageBuffers generated from an image stream. The
 * image stream may come from a Bitmap, a Mask, or a video-related object of the native
 * platform. You should call ImageReader::acquireNextBuffer() to read a new ImageBuffer each time
 * when the image stream is modified. All ImageBuffers generated from one ImageReader share the same
 * internal texture, which allows you to continuously read the latest content from the image stream
 * with minimal memory copying. However, there are two limits:
 *
 *    1) The generated ImageBuffers are bound to the associated GPU Context when first being drawn
 *       and cannot be drawn to another Context anymore.
 *    2) The generated ImageBuffers may have a limited lifetime and cannot create textures after
 *       expiration. Usually, the previously acquired ImageBuffer will expire after the newly
 *       created ImageBuffer is drawn. So there are only two ImageBuffers that can be accessed
 *       simultaneously. But if the image stream is backed by a hardware buffer, the previously
 *       acquired ImageBuffer immediately expires when the image stream is being modified.
 *
 * You can create multiple ImageReaders from the same image stream. ImageReader is safe across
 * threads.
